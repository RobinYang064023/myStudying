# Chapter 4 Examing the Specification

---

- Black-Box Testing
  - You test it when you don't actually know about the detail inside the box(what the code actually does).
  - Sometimes, Black-Box Testing is referred to as functional testing or behavioral testing by meaning.
- White-Box Testing
  - You test it when you know about the detail inside the box.
  - Be aware of stepping into the trap that you tailor(fit) the tests to match the code's operation.
- Static Testing
  - Test something that is not running.
- Dynamic Testing
  - Test somethinh that is running.
- Static Black-Box Testing
  - Test the specification
- High-Level Review of the Specification
  - Pretebd to Be the Customer
    - Check the spec if it meet the customer's need or not.
  - Research Existing Standard and Guidelines
    - Standards should be strictly adhered to if your team has decided that it's import to comply with them completely.
    - Guidelines are optional but should be followed.
    - Corporate Terminology and Conventions
      - It should adopt the common terms and conventions used by the users.

    - GUI
    - Security Standards

  - Specification Attributes Checklist
    - Complete
      - Is anything missing or forgotten?
      - Is it thorough?
      - Does it include everything necessary to make it stand alone.
    - Accurate
      - Is the proposed solution correct?
      - Does it properly define the goal?
      - Are there any errors?
    - Precise, Unambiguous, and Clear
      - Is the description exact and not vague?
      - Is there a single interpretation?
      - Is it easy to read and understand?
    - Consistent
      - Is the description of the feature written so that it doesn't conflict with itself or other items in the specification?
    - Relevant
      - Is the statement necessary to specify the feature?
      - Is it extra information that should be left out?
      - Is the feature traceable to an original customer?
    - Feasible
      - Can the feature be implemented with the available personnel, tools, and resources within the specified budget and schedule?
    - Code-free
      - Does the specification stick with defining the product and not the underlying software design, architecture, code?
    - Testable
      - Can the feature be tested?
      - Is enough information provided that a tester could create tests to verify its operation?
  - Specification Terminology Checklist
    - Always, Every, All, None, Never
