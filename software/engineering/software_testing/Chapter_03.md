# Chapter 3 - The Realities of Software Testing

---

- Precision and Accuracy
  - An example in dart game.
    - Accuracy means you hit near target.
    - Precision means you hit concentratedly(always hit the same place).
  - It can be \"Neither Accurate nor Precise\", \"Precise, but not Accurate", \"Accurate, but not Precise", "Accurate and Precise".
- Verification and Validation
  - Verification
    - The product statisifies the specification.
  - Validation
    - The product statistifies the user's requirement.
  - There is a possisible situation that the verification is good as well as the validation is bad if the specification isn't that great.
- Quality and Reliability
  - Quality
    - We say that the product is of high quality if it met customer's needs great.
  - Reliability
    - We say that the product is of high reliability if it nearly never crashes and trashes his data.
  - In fact, Reilability is one of the Quality.
- Testing and Quality Assurance (QA)
  - Testing
    - The goal is to find bugs, and make sure they get fixed.
  - Quality Assurance
    - Create or enforce standards and methods to improve the development process and to prevent bugs from ever occuring.
